## How to play?
After installing the requirements, run the server script on your computer or server. If you run the script in a server, change "localhost" to "server's IP". While the server script is running, run the client scripts and play.</br></br>
You may need [Logmein Hamachi](https://www.vpn.net/) to play on localhost with your friend.

## Notes
This project was developed on a short deadline. My concern was getting the project functional, rather than designing a cleaner or scalable code.</br></br>
The goal of the project is to implement a functional server using socket programming.
